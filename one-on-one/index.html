<h1>One-on-One</h1>
<p>PowerChord Theory is built on the idea that most people can learn on their own. With the amount of information available today, self-teaching is a natural path for many musicians. The challenge is often knowing what to focus on and how to move forward with clarity.</p>
<p>One-on-one sessions exist for players who benefit from additional direction and structured support.</p>
<div class="section-grid">
<div class="section-box">
<h2>Session Focus</h2>
<p>
One-on-one sessions are centered on groove, time, touch, and musical awareness.
Technique and theory are introduced only as they become useful. Sessions adapt to
the individual and are shaped by current ability and goals.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section-box">
<h2>Custom Materials</h2>
<p>
Students receive practice materials tailored to their level and needs. These include
professionally developed backing tracks, exercises, and song-based studies created
specifically for each player. Materials are produced in a recording environment and
designed to support real musical growth.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section-box">
<h2>Groove-Based Approach</h2>
<p>
The learning model prioritizes rhythm, feel, and consistency. Songs are used as tools
to explore musical ideas and develop listening skills. The approach reflects how
musicians develop in real playing situations.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section-box">
<h2>Coaching Experience</h2>
<p>
One-on-one guidance is informed by professional experience in performance, recording,
touring, and formal study. The focus remains on practical skills that translate beyond
the practice space.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section-box">
<h2>Gear Support</h2>
<p>
Guidance can include instrument selection, practice setups, amplification, and recording
basics. Gear advice is practical and goal-driven, with dedicated sessions available
for buying support.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section-box">
<h2>Format</h2>
<p>
Sessions are offered remotely by default, with hybrid options available for local
players. Availability is intentionally limited to maintain quality and focus.
